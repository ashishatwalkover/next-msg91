                                        6. You acknowledge that TEAM MSG91 delivers SMS’s via major telecom operators and can therefore only influence the delivery transmission of SMS within the technical constraints imposed. SMS’s submitted via Internet will be transferred to mobile network providers, provided that the recipient’s phone is switched on and doesn’t have a full memory and is located in an area covered by its subscribed mobile network provider. You acknowledge that, depending on the recipient’s mobile provider service, it may not be possible to transmit the SMS to the recipient successfully. <br></br>
                                        <br></br>
                                        7. You are responsible for the privacy and storage of the user-name and password. You agree to be legally bound by all the activities carried out through your account. <br></br>

                                        8. TEAM MSG91 neither claims nor guarantees the availability or performance of this service and accepts no liability for transmission delays or message failures. While TEAM MSG91 makes every effort to deliver messages promptly. <br></br>

                                        9. TEAM MSG91 doesn’t refund the credits for undeliverable messages to you because we cannot guarantee delivery of the SMS’s to recipients due to possible errors. TEAM MSG91 debits transmitted SMS’s according to its transmission logs. These logs are deemed correct and valid even if the customer has objected to the correctness of the accounting records, except if investigation by TEAM MSG91 has produced evidence of a technical problem or error. <br></br>
                                        <br></br>
                                        10. TEAM MSG91 reserves the right to exclude you from using this service, refunding you any remaining amount in your account. All purchases must be considered as final, in compliance with our no refund policy. <br></br>

                                        11. The SMS account balance is non-refundable and does not bear any interest. All the SMS’s must be used in the validity period from the date of the purchase. No carry forward of the credits will be made unless otherwise defined in a separate contract. <br></br>
                                        <br></br>

                                        13. You shall indemnify and reimburse TEAM MSG91 all liabilities, costs, losses and damages, in case of any claim brought against TEAM MSG91 from any third party due to breach of contract. <br></br>
                                        <br></br>
                                        14. You shall in no way raise questions concerning our price policy since it is liable to change with due amendments in the Government, TRAI or Telecom Operators rules and regulations. <br></br>
