        <span className="c-fs-3">A well-established communication channel with customers is a key requirement to ensure better operations. Setting up seamless operations while maintaining a wide range of customer base without a robust and secure communication channel is a challenge. Thus to convey important information like booking details, offers and updates for building a strong customer relationship, a communication channel targeting wide reach for mass audience (customers) is required.</span>

      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Solution</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">Smart Shift is managing their operations and customer communication efficiently with SMS communications via MSG91 API. With MSG91 APIs and real-time robust system, SMS is delivered to the customers to built communication at different events such as</span>
        <ul>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">As soon as the customer signs up, they receive the <a href="#">Verification code OTP </a> via SMS.</li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">Every time the customer <a href="#"> makes a new shift </a> , they receives an OTP along with the billing details via SMS. This OTP has to be shared with the logistics operator in order to start the shift.</li>
        </ul>
        <span className="c-fs-3">This way Smart Shift has been able to establish and maintain an effective communication with Customers via SMS using MSG91 API.</span>
