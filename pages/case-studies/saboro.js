        <ul>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">Upon the Sign up the customer receives an <a href="#"> OTP for the verification </a> , making it secured.</li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">Once the customer makes an order, he/she receives an SMS for the  <a href="#"> Order Confirmation. </a></li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">Upon the confirmation when the order is delivered, the customer gets notified with the  <a href="#"> Order Delivery SMS. </a></li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">If the order is cancelled, then the customer gets notified for the  <a href="#"> Order Cancellation SMS. </a></li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">Apart from the notifications regarding Orders, clients also receive  <a href="#"> Offers, Alerts and other information via SMS. </a></li>
