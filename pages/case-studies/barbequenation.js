      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Problem</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">A well-established communication channel with customers is a key requirement to ensure better operations. Setting up seamless operations while maintaining a wide range of customer base without a robust and secure communication channel is a challenge. Thus to convey important information like booking details, offers and updates for building a strong customer relationship, a communication channel targeting wide reach for mass audience (customers) is required.</span>
      </div>

      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Solution</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">Barbeque Nation is managing their operations by its website https://www.barbequenation.com/ and customer communication efficiently with SMS communications via MSG91 API. With MSG91 APIs and real-time robust system, SMS is delivered to the customers to build communication at different events such as:</span>
        <ul>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">Once the customer <a href="#">makes a reservation </a>, the customer receives an <a href="#">Reservation Confirmation SMS.</a></li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">If the <a href="#">eservation gets cancelled </a>, the customer receives an <a href="#">Reservation Cancellation SMS.</a></li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">Customer receives SMS notifications regarding all the <a href="#">Ongoing Offers and Updates.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <span className="c-fs-3">This way Barbeque Nation has been able to establish and maintain an effective communication with Customers via SMS using MSG91 API.</span>

      <div className="container py-5">
