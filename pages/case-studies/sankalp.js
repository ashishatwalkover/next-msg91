      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Problem</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">A well-established communication channel with customers is a key requirement to ensure better operations. Setting up seamless operations while maintaining a wide range of customer base without a robust and secure communication channel is a challenge. Thus to convey important information like booking details, offers and updates for building a strong customer relationship, a communication channel targeting wide reach for mass audience (customers) is required.</span>
      </div>

      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Solution</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">Sankalp India Foundation is managing their operations and communication efficiently with SMS communications via MSG91 API. With MSG91 APIs and real-time robust system, SMS is delivered to the volunteers and patients to build communication at different events such as</span>
        <ul>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">Volunteers are <a href="#"> informed about the blood donation camps and drives </a> via SMS containing details of the drive.</li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">Kin of the patients are sent <a href="#"> details of the Blood Banks which have the required blood group units </a> via SMS.</li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1">SMS regarding <a href="#"> blood units requirements in emergency and the details </a> are sent to volunteers having the required blood group.</li>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-1"><a href="#"> Blood donation requests for Bombay Blood Group along with details</a> are sent to the registered Bombay blood Group donors via SMS.</li>
        </ul>
        <span className="c-fs-3">This way Sankalp India Foundation has been able to establish and maintain an effective coordination with donors and patients via SMS using MSG91 API.</span>
      </div>

      <div className="container py-5">
