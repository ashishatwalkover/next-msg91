                    <div className="my-3"></div>
                    GDPR is an opportunity to build a stronger data protection foundation. It is designed to give you more control over your personal data by simplifying the regulatory environment for business so you and your business can fully benefit from the digital economy.
                    <div className="my-3"></div>
                    Although GDPR has been implemented just some time back (May 2018), for MSG91 it has always been a part of the culture and practices. GDPR has not just been a compliance practice for us at MSG91 but it has always been about the trust our customers have garnered on us and the responsibility which lies with us to keep their data protected.
                    <div className="my-3"></div>
                    Here’s how MSG91 follows GDPR compliance
